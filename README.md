# Overview

This software is an application written R that leverages a library called Shiny for rendering the UI. Its' main functionality is a plotting application that allows a user to upload a csv file and choose different x/y columns to plot a line on, and after it plots the data, it performs linear regression on the plot to find the equation of the line, which it then displays.

I wrote this software to learn about the R language. This software introduced me to different R datatypes. I love build UI in different languages, and this project gave me an incentive to learn add a library called "Shiny" to my list.
